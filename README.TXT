Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

1)
2)the value returned by the machine after a ticket being printed is 0.
3)The machine will print the ticket no matter what.
    The machine will not give you a refund if you insert more amount that you are supposed to in the machine
4)
5)the ticket looks almost the same
     the only diffrence is that the amount on the ticket is 
     going to be diffrent compared to the other because we used diffrent price for the ticket.
6)public class Student{} and public class LabClass{} 
7)Yes. Yes the diagram is diffrent is has red lines on it.The error says "class,interface,enum or record expected".this error doesnt clearly say the
    problem with the code but it gives you a hint that the problem is with the class.
8) yes it is possible to leave out the word public from "public class TicketMachine".
9) no it is not possible to leave out the word class from the code.
10)constructor=TicketMachine
    fields=(private int balance),(private int price),(private int total) etc...
    methods=getPrice() , getBalance() , void etc...
    
11)the name because the name of the constructor is the same as the class name and a contructor does not have a return type before it.
12)count= the type is int
    representative=Student
    host=Server
13)alive
    tutor
    game
14)Student, Server, Person, Game
15)yes the order of the declaration matters. If your change the order the code will not compli the diagram will also show error and the editor will
    give that message about the syntax error.
16) yes it is necessary to add the semicolon after each statement because if you dont add a semicolon at the end the code will not compile since 
    the statement does not have an end.
